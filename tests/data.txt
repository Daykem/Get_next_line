DESCRIPTION
       man is the system's manual pager.  Each page argument given to  man
       is normally the name of a program, utility or function.  The manual
       page associated with each of these arguments is then found and dis‐
       played.   A  section,  if provided, will direct man to look only in
       that section of the manual.  The default action is to search in all
       of  the available sections following a pre-defined order (1 1p 8 2
       3 3p 4 5 6 7 9 0p n l p o 1x 2x 3x 4x 5x  6x  7x  8x  by  default,
       unless  overridden  by  the SECTION directive in /etc/man_db.conf),
       and to show only the first page found, even if page exists in  sev‐
       eral sections.

       The table below shows the section numbers of the manual followed by
       the types of pages they contain.

       1   Executable programs or shell commands
       2   System calls (functions provided by the kernel)
       3   Library calls (functions within program libraries)
       4   Special files (usually found in /dev)
       5   File formats and conventions eg /etc/passwd
       6   Games
       7   Miscellaneous (including macro packages and conventions),  e.g.
           man(7), groff(7)
       8   System administration commands (usually only for root)
       9   Kernel routines [Non standard]
